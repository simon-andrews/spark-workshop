\begin{frame}{Who is this workshop for?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This workshop was \textit{designed} for students and recent graduates of COMPSCI 121/186/187 at UMass who want to make something useful with their new Java skills.
    \item This workshop will \textit{probably be useful} to anyone with any programming experience in any language.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Before we get started}
Do you have a copy of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed?

Open a terminal and try to run ``javac''.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If you get a whole bunch of lines, you're set.
    \item If you get something about javac not being found, you'll need a copy of the JDK. Visit \url{https://adoptopenjdk.net/} and grab yourself a copy!
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What's the plan for today?}

\end{center}
In one hour we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Give a whirlwind introduction to HTTP and Gradle.
    \item Build a ``hello world'' website.
    \item Build a super bare-bones calculator application.
    \item Flesh out our calculator application a bit so it's more like a project you would actually make.
\end{itemize}
